== Installing JsSpec
You can use JsSpec as a gem or as a Rails plugin.
To install the gem, run:
  sudo gem install js_spec

To install the plugin, run:
  script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/pivotalrb/js_spec/trunk
  script/generate js_spec

The Rails plugin gives you generators when using JsSpec in a Rails environment.

== Using JsSpec
js_spec_server /path/to/your/javascript/spec/files /path/to/your/javascript/implementation/files

Open your browser to http://localhost:8080/specs or run selenium and then run js_spec

== JsSpec on CI
JS spec uses the Selenium gem to automatically control browsers on different machines.

To use JsSpec in a CI environment,
  * Install and run the selenium RC server on the machine that you want to run the browsers by using the command:
    selenium
  * Run the js_spec_server on the machine that has the files.
    script/js_spec_server
  * Run the js_spec client. The js_spec client has --selenium_host, --selenium_port, and --spec_url arguments to specify
    where the Selenium server is relative to the js_spec server, and where the js_spec server is relative to the browser.
